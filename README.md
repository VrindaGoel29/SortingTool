# SortingTool

This is a simple Java command-line program I built to practice some classic sorting algorithms:
- Merge Sort  
- Quick Sort  
- Bubble Sort  

## What it does
You can enter a list of numbers, choose which sorting method you want, and it will show you the sorted list. It’s a small project but helped me understand how these algorithms work in real code!

## How to run it
1. Download or clone this repo.  
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and go to the folder where the files are.  
3. Compile the code by running:  
   javac SortingTool.java
   
Run the program with:
java SortingTool
Follow the prompts to enter your numbers and pick the sorting algorithm.

What I learned
How recursive algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort really work.
Writing clean Java code for input/output in the terminal.
Getting comfortable with basic algorithm implementation and problem solving.
